TopView:
with offset by 'x' 120 "set 2" is a center element

So 120 + 320 + 120 = 560, width of TopView

120+320/2 = 280 by x, center of "set 2"
280-120   = 160 by x, center of "set 1"
280+120   = 400 by x, center of "set 3"
and continue...

If we change a positions of elements above, we will have "dragging".
